## Description and Programming Interests
My name is **Hussain Hunaid**, and I have a strong interest in _programming_ because I like solving problems and building creative solutions through code. I like exploring different programming languages and understanding how each one can be applied to solve real-life problems. What excites me is turning ideas into functional application.
